In this paper, authors address the problem of finding a novel document descriptor based on the covariance matrix of a word vector. 
The descriptor has a fixed length, which makes it easy to use in supervised and unsupervised applications. 
They tested their novel descriptor for a range of tasks including supervised and unsupervised settings.
